Note that this is specific to SSR.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason why this occurred is because there was an attempt in converting `value` to a string at line 733, which would then throw if the type of `value` was a `symbol` or `function`. So to prevent this from happening, I re-used the function `shouldRemoveAttributeWithWarning` to firstly determine if the value was a `symbol` or `function` (or any other invalid type) before casting this into a string.\\r\\n\\r\\n## How did you test this change?\\r\\nI tested this by setting up a simple react component as shown below, and utilised `ReactDOMServer.renderToString` to render the component and sent this to the client (effectively replicating SSR behaviour). \\r\\n```\\r\\n  export default () => {\\r\\n    return (\\r\\n      <>\\r\\n        <label htmlFor=\\"letters\\">Choose a letter:</label>\\r\\n\\r\\n        <select>\\r\\n          <option value={Symbol(\'test\')}>A</option>\\r\\n          <option value=\\"B\\">B</option>\\r\\n          <option value=\\"C\\">C</option>\\r\\n          <option value=\\"D\\">D</option>\\r\\n        </select>\\r\\n      </>\\r\\n    );\\r\\n  };\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nBehaviour if using Main branch (further debug information that is provided as part of the error message has been omitted):\\r\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47930216/143719364-b5e5341c-9c55-494b-9b94-3257d8809f78.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nBehaviour with my changes:\\r\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47930216/143718624-1e828a35-389e-40bd-8973-9f2ea5a11f8c.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that I did attempt to write a test (via the file `ReactDOMServerIntegrationSelect-test`) to confirm that the html option object\'s `value` property is empty if the developer specifies a `symbol` or `function` type. However, although this test would pass for client-side rendered html elements, this does not pass if rendered server side (even though no `value` attribute is explicitly attached to the option element). If rendered server-side and if the option\'s `value` attribute is queried, it looks like the option element will implicitly return its child text element if its `value` attribute is empty. So going with the markup above as an example, querying the value for the first option element will return \\"A\\" if rendered server side. This does bring to light some very subtle differences in behaviour both server and client-side that I\'m not too sure is worth addressing in this PR.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\'s the test that I wrote below just as an FYI:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n itRenders(\\r\\n    \'a select option with no value if the initial value was a symbol type\',\\r\\n    async render => {\\r\\n      const e = await render(\\r\\n        <select readOnly={true}>\\r\\n          <option value={Symbol(\'test\')}>A</option>\\r\\n        </select>,\\r\\n        1\\r\\n      );\\r\\n      const option = e.options[0];\\r\\n      expect(option.value).toBe(\'\');\\r\\n    }\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/22841/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/22841/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/22840","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/22840/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/22840/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/22840/events","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/22840","id":1065100791,"node_id":"I_kwDOAJy2Ks4_fCX3","number":22840,"title":"`Object.prototype` builtins should not be used directly","user":{"login":"Biki-das","id":72331432,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMzMxNDMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72331432?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biki-das","html_url":"https://github.com/Biki-das","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biki-das/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biki-das/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biki-das/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biki-das/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biki-das/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biki-das/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biki-das/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biki-das/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biki-das/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":155984160,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTU5ODQxNjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/Status:%20Unconfirmed","name":"Status: Unconfirmed","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"A potential issue that we haven\'t yet confirmed as a bug"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2021-11-27T18:11:58Z","updated_at":"2021-11-27T18:16:43Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"It is preferable to call certain Object.prototype methods through Object on object instances instead of using the builtins directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nObjects can have properties that shadow the builtins on Object.prototype, potentially causing unintended behavior or denial-of-service security vulnerabilities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s better to always call these methods from ``Object.prototype``.

webdriver/browser.\\r\\n- current advice for `Render Callbacks` at https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/5\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsx\\r\\nfunction App({ callback }) {\\r\\n  // Callback will be

advice is working as expected, and waiting for callback results the expected HTML to be presented in DOM, except:\\r\\n- it does not wait for any `useEffect`\\r\\n- it does not guarantee that everything else is rendered, because Concurrent Mode does not guarantee this by default.\\r\\n- it cannot handle updates\\r\\n\\r\\nWondering, is there any way to:\\r\\n- await for all currently scheduled work to be executed\\r\\n- synchronously flush all unfinished work\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s also worth clarifying that in the given example React is working in a little synthetic environment, which is neither real browser nor a unit test.

about it considering it probably unmounts its own `script` tag?\\r\\n\\r\\nReact 17 behavior: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-17-hydration-mismatch-in-document-m22vv\\r\\n\\r\\nThe good thing is that frameworks can guard against author error by wrapping user code in Suspense boundaries so that any hydration mismatch from user code does not result in throwing away the main script (or too much in general). But that might require a lot of otherwise unnecessary Suspense boundaries (is that a problem?)\\r\\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/22833/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/22833/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/22832","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/22832/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/22832/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/22832/events","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/22832","id":1063922164,"node_id":"I_kwDOAJy2Ks4_ain0","number":22832,"title":"Update Server Components dependencies","user":{"login":"gaearon","id":810438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDQzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/810438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon","html_url":"https://github.com/gaearon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaearon/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":155984160,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTU5ODQxNjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/Status:%20Unconfirmed","name":"Status: Unconfirmed","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"A potential issue that we haven\'t yet confirmed as a bug"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2021-11-25T21:13:58Z","updated_at":"2021-11-25T21:29:22Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"There\'s been some releases of underlying tools and we need to catch up.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [ ] Add webpack 5+ dep to the webpack plugin #22739 \\r\\n- [ ] Get `fixtures/flight` running again\\r\\n  -
